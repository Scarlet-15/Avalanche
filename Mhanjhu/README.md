# Avalanche Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to the Smart India Hackathon project aimed at predicting areas prone to avalanches. The core idea behind this project is to utilize advanced modeling techniques to forecast regions where avalanches are likely to occur. The project employs three distinct types of models to achieve this goal:

1. **Time Series Model**: This model utilizes historical weather data obtained from APIs to predict the weather conditions for the next day. By analyzing patterns in weather data over the last 30 days, the model generates forecasts that are crucial for understanding avalanche risks.

2. **Classification Model**: A standard classification model is employed to determine whether a particular region is likely to be affected by an avalanche or not. By analyzing various factors such as terrain, elevation, and historical avalanche data, the classification model provides insights into the vulnerability of specific areas.

3. **Image Segmentation Model**: Utilizing image segmentation techniques, this model predicts the geological positions on a map where avalanches are likely to hit. By analyzing satellite imagery and geological features, the model identifies high-risk zones where avalanche occurrences are more probable.

The integration of the outputs from these three models forms the basis for an effective avalanche prediction system. By combining the forecasts generated by each model, the system can identify regions with heightened avalanche risks.

## Project Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to leverage the hybrid outputs of the time series model, classification model, and image segmentation model to alert residents of potentially affected regions about the imminent threat of avalanches. By sending SMS alerts to individuals residing in high-risk areas, the project aims to minimize the impact of avalanches by enabling timely evacuation and safety measures.
